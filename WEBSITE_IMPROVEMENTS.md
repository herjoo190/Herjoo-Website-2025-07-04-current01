# Website Improvement Suggestions (Style-Preserving)

Here is a list of potential improvements for the website that enhance performance, user experience, and SEO without altering the core visual style.

### 1. Performance & Optimization

*   **Optimize Images:** Compress images and serve them in a modern format like **WebP** with fallbacks to JPG/PNG. This drastically reduces file size and improves page load times, especially on mobile.
*   **Minify & Purge CSS:** Use the Tailwind CLI to **purge** all unused styles from the final CSS file. A smaller CSS file is downloaded and processed much faster.
*   **Defer Non-critical Scripts:** Load the main JavaScript block with the `defer` attribute (`<script defer>`). This prevents the script from "blocking" the rendering of the page, improving perceived load time.

### 2. SEO & Content Strategy

*   **Enhance Meta Tags:**
    *   Add a **meta description** to control the snippet that appears in Google search results.
    *   Add **Open Graph (OG) tags** to control how the site appears when shared on social media.
*   **Flesh Out Service Sections:** Expand the placeholder service sections (`#service-google-ads`, etc.) with detailed content about the benefits, process, and unique value of each service. This builds authority and improves SEO.
*   **Add a Call-to-Action (CTA) in the Footer:** Include a final, soft CTA in the footer (e.g., "Ready to get started?") to give users who scroll to the bottom a clear next step.

### 3. Accessibility (A11y)

*   **Add "Skip to Main Content" Link:** Implement a hidden link that allows keyboard users to bypass the header navigation and jump directly to the main content.
*   **Ensure All Interactive Elements Have Focus States:** Make sure all links and buttons have a clear visual indicator when they are focused using keyboard navigation, not just form inputs.

### 4. UX & Functionality

*   **Provide Form Submission Feedback:** Instead of navigating away, submit the contact form in the background and display an inline "Thank you" message within the modal for immediate feedback.
*   **Add Subtle Hover Effects:** Apply consistent, subtle hover effects to all interactive elements (navigation links, footer links, service cards) to make the site feel more responsive and polished.
